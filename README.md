# LED-Dimmer

You will make a system which allows you to control the brightness of an external LED using your potentiometer. Your LED will be controlled by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal, so a higher duty cycle will lead to a brighter LED. A user will control the duty cycle of the PWM signal by turning the potentiometer. 

One suggestion is to make sure that the duty cycle ranges between 60% and 100%. If the duty cycle is below ~60% then the LED might not light at all.
