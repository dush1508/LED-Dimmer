# LED-Dimmer

This is a system which allows you to control the brightness of an external LED using your potentiometer. The LED is controlled by a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal, so a higher duty cycle will lead to a brighter LED. The user will control the duty cycle of the PWM signal by turning the potentiometer.
